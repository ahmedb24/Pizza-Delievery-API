# Pizza-Delievery-API
An API built with Nodejs and zero external libraries. 


This project seeks to illustrate how powerful Nodejs can be from handling requests to spinning 
up background processes, hashing, building templates, performing string interpolation and so much
more all without the use of external libraries.
